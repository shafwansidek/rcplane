## RC Plane Altimeter Sensing for Safe Aerobatics:
# Airframe and Receiver Protocol

These codes were used for my project to measure the height of the RC plane as well as sensing its acceleration on the x-axis, y-axis and z-axis. The codes is split into 2: TX, codes for the transmitter and RX, codes for the receiver.
